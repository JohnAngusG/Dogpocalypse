# DogPocalypse

You play as a dog named Lucky, tasked with finding food for your human during the zombie apocalypse. You must hide from the zombies and collect the three burgers scattered throughout the level.

## Feelings about the project

I had a lot of fun developing this game, simple as it is. It was my first "big" Unity game and taught me a lot about the intricacies of the engine. I would like to revisit this project at some point to iron out the bugs and improve the detection mechanic.

## Lessons

* Loading different scenes.
* Implementing a dialogue mechanic.
* Compiling a project for Web and Desktop.
* Creating an Animation Controller and a blend tree.
* Level design and whiteboxing.
